When creating a Chrome extension or app, you need to provide a set of icons for
browser actions, page actions, context menus, and other places. Usually,
these are just the same image resized. chrome-manifest-iconify is designed to
simplify the process of creating all these icons by properly resizing them for
you. Just provide it a master icon and the v2 manifest file. It will parse
the manifest to determine all the icon sizes, names, and paths. You can choose
from several resizing algorithms as provide by
[JIMP](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp).
